# Contributing to HVAC Business Scraper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HVAC Business Scraper! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Flask and web scraping

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hvac-business-scraper.git
   cd hvac-business-scraper
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Create environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your development settings
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use Git Flow for branch management:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Creating a Feature

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   
   # Run code quality checks
   black src/
   flake8 src/
   mypy src/
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description
   
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Any breaking changes
   - References to issues"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Imports**: Use isort for import organization
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all functions
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings

Example:
```python
def scrape_business_data(location: str, business_type: str = "HVAC") -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Scrape business data from Google Maps.
    
    Args:
        location: The location to search in
        business_type: Type of business to search for
        
    Returns:
        List of business data dictionaries
        
    Raises:
        ScrapingError: If scraping fails
    """
    pass
```

### Frontend Code Style

- **HTML**: Use semantic HTML5 elements
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind CSS classes, avoid custom CSS when possible
- **JavaScript**: Use modern ES6+ syntax, prefer const/let over var

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

Example:
```python
def test_scrape_business_data_returns_valid_results():
    """Test that scraping returns properly formatted business data."""
    # Arrange
    scraper = HVACScraper()
    location = "Boise, ID"
    
    # Act
    results = scraper.scrape_business_data(location)
    
    # Assert
    assert isinstance(results, list)
    assert len(results) > 0
    assert all('name' in business for business in results)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scraper.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_scraper"
```

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Include type hints for better code understanding
- Comment complex logic and business rules

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include screenshots for UI changes

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Clear description** of the issue
2. **Steps to reproduce** the problem
3. **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
4. **Environment details** (OS, Python version, browser)
5. **Screenshots** if applicable
6. **Error messages** and stack traces

Use the bug report template when creating issues.

## üí° Feature Requests

For new features, please:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the problem** you're trying to solve
3. **Propose a solution** with implementation details
4. **Consider alternatives** and their trade-offs
5. **Provide use cases** and examples

Use the feature request template when creating issues.
